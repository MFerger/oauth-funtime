There are two main goals for this lesson: to get familiar with Passport, and to hone your documentation interaction abilities. Note "documentation interaction" - not "reading documentation". Documentation is rarely a step-by-step tutorial. Instead, it's an active process of knowing what to look for, seeking it out, pattern matching and only pulling in the few lines necessary to satisfy the errors you are getting.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

Describe and explain OAuth and it's role in web authentication (content)
Carefully read error messages generated from framework code and reason through possible causes based on current knowledge of Express
Use targeted searches in documentation to answer specific questions or inform hypothesis
use CMD+F on web pages
Deploy an app that uses OAuth with Passport
You do not need to memorize every step in this document. Using framework code is all about combining what you know with your critical thinking skills and targeted documentation searches. Most of this lesson is about non-cognitive behaviors.
